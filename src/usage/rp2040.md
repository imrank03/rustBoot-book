# `rp2040`

The `rp2040` example uses a [Raspberry Pi Pico Board](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). The board has 1 user LED which will be blinking at different frequencies depending on whether we're executing boot-firmware or update-firmware.

## Raspberry Pi Pico's Boot Sequence

Raspberry Pi Pico board has an external QSPI Flash chip `W25Q080` with support for cached execute-in-place. 
It has a first stage bootloader baked into ROM. This is always the very first thing that runs when the RP2040 starts up.
The built-in bootloader has a fixed sequence,  it checks if the BOOTSEL button is pressed, and if so, enters the USB mass storage mode for code upload. 
If the BOOTSEL button is not pressed, and it looks like the flash contains a valid program, then it starts executing the “program” from flash.

In flash, first 256 bytes are second-stage bootloader which are required to configure external QSPI flash for high speed and efficient code access.

> Note:  For this example we are using two Pico boards, one board will be used as debug probe and other will be a target board. You can learn more about this [here](https://wiki.freepascal.org/ARM_Embedded_Tutorial_-_Raspberry_Pi_Pico_Setting_up_for_Development)

## Partitioning

The first step in integrating rustBoot is `flash-memory partitioning` i.e. we divide the `Pico`'s flash-memory into 4 partitions, taking into account the geometry of the flash memory. 

> You can read more about `mcu` partitioning [here](../arch/partitions.md#micro-controller-partitions)

In this example, we'll be using the following partitioning scheme. You can locate these constants in the [constants module](https://github.com/nihalpasham/rustBoot/blob/main/rustBoot/src/constants.rs)

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "rp2040")]
pub const SECTOR_SIZE: usize = 0x1000;
#[cfg(feature = "rp2040")]
pub const PARTITION_SIZE: usize = 0x20000;
#[cfg(feature = "rp2040")]
pub const BOOT_PARTITION_ADDRESS: usize = 0x10020000;
#[cfg(feature = "rp2040")]
pub const UPDATE_PARTITION_ADDRESS: usize = 0x10040000;
#[cfg(feature = "rp2040")]
pub const SWAP_PARTITION_ADDRESS: usize = 0x10060000;
```
> Note: Choose the number of sectors based on your boot and update firmware sizes.

 **`RUSTBOOT partition:`** contains the bootloader (its code and data) and a (test) public-key embedded as part of the bootloader image, starts at address `0x10000100`.
- **`BOOT partition:`** contains boot firmware, starts at address `PARTITION_BOOT_ADDRESS`.
- **`UPDATE partition:`** contains update firmware, starts at address `UPDATE_PARTITION_ADDRESS`. The boot firmware is responsible for downloading and installing the update firmware into this partition via a secure channel.
- **`SWAP partition:`** is the temporary swap space, starts at address `SWAP_PARTITION_ADDRESS`. 

## Compiling, Signing and Programming: 

Now that we have properly partitioned the `Pico`'s on-board flash-memory, the next step is - `compiling, signing and programming ` 

We will compile the following 
- bootloader 
- boot and update firmware

sign both pieces of firmware with a (test) [private-key](https://github.com/nihalpasham/rustBoot/tree/main/boards/rbSigner/keygen) and finally create valid [`rustBoot mcu-images`](../arch/images.md#mcu-image-format) i.e. signed boot and update firmware images.

> Note:
> - the `ecc256.der` file contains a public-key and a private-key, the first 64 bytes being the public-key and remaining 32 bytes make up the private-key. 
> - This is a test key file and is to be used for testing purposes only.

Compiling, signing and programming can be performed via a single command

```Terminal
cargo stm32f334 build-sign-flash rustBoot [boot-ver] [updt-ver]
```
> Note:
> - The `updt-ver` number should be greater than `boot-ver`.

This will build, sign and flash all 3 packages (i.e. bootloader + boot-fw + update-fw) onto the board.

> Note: 
> - The corresponding public-key is embedded in the bootloader's source.
> - In order to test this example, you'll have to install a couple of pre-requisites  as it uses probe-run to flash the binary.

```powershell
cargo install probe-rs-cli 
cargo install cargo-flash
cargo install cargo-binutils
```
 
Here's the command and its output that should be produced.

```Terminal
cargo rp2040 build-sign-flash rustBoot 1234 1235
```

## Verifying:

`user led` is used to confirm that rustBoot works as expected. Here's the flow

- Upon supplying power to the board, rustBoot takes over 
    - validates the firmware image stored in the BOOT partition
    - verifies the signature attached against a known public key stored in the rustBoot image.
- If the signature checks out, rustBoot boots into the bootfw and blinks a `user led` for a few seconds, at an interval of `1 second` five times.
    - post which, the boot firmware triggers the update and performs a system reset. 
- Upon reset, the rustBoot again takes over 
    - validates the firmware image stored in the UPDATE partition 
    - swaps the contents of the BOOT and the UPDATE partitions
    - marks the new firmware in the BOOT partition as in state STATE_TESTING
    - boots into the UPDATE'd firmware 
- Now that execution-control has been transferred to the UPDATE'd firmware 
    - and set a `confirmation flag` to indicate that the update was successful.
    - post which, it continuously blinks a `user led` at an interval of `0.125 second` continuously.
