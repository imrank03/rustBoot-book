# `stm32f334`

The `stm32f334` example uses a [STM32F334 Nucleo-64 Board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f334r8.html). The board has 1 user LED which will be blinking at different frequencies depending on whether we're executing boot-firmware or update-firmware.

> Note 
> - If you're using a different version of the board, you'll probably need to edit your firmware's `partition-addresses` to accommodate for differences. 
> - Just make sure you don't change the names of files or the folder structure, as cargo xtask looks for these file/folder names.

 ## Partitioning

The first step in integrating rustBoot is `flash-memory partitioning` i.e. we divide the `stm32f334`'s flash-memory into 4 partitions, taking into account the geometry of the flash memory. 

> You can read more about `mcu` partitioning [here](../arch/partitions.md#micro-controller-partitions)

In this example, we'll be using the following partitioning scheme. You can locate these constants in the [constants module](https://github.com/nihalpasham/rustBoot/blob/main/rustBoot/src/constants.rs)

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "stm32f334")]
pub const SECTOR_SIZE: usize = 0x1800; 
#[cfg(feature = "stm32f334")]
pub const PARTITION_SIZE: usize = 0x1800;
#[cfg(feature = "stm32f334")]
pub const BOOT_PARTITION_ADDRESS: usize = 0x0800b800; //its is of 3 pages starting from this address as the boot firmware is 2.47KiB
#[cfg(feature = "stm32f334")]
pub const SWAP_PARTITION_ADDRESS: usize = 0x0800e800; //its is of 3 pages starting from this address
#[cfg(feature = "stm32f334")]
pub const UPDATE_PARTITION_ADDRESS: usize = 0x0800d000; //its is of 3 pages starting from this address as the update firmware is 2.50KiB

> Note: Choose the number of pages based on your boot and update firmware sizes.

```
 **`RUSTBOOT partition:`** contains the bootloader (its code and data) and a (test) public-key embedded as part of the bootloader image, starts at address `0x0800_0000`.
- **`BOOT partition:`** contains boot firmware, starts at address `PARTITION_BOOT_ADDRESS`.
- **`UPDATE partition:`** contains update firmware, starts at address `UPDATE_PARTITION_ADDRESS`. The boot firmware is responsible for downloading and installing the update firmware into this partition via a secure channel.
- **`SWAP partition:`** is the temporary swap space, starts at address `SWAP_PARTITION_ADDRESS`. 

## Compiling, Signing and Programming: 

Now that we have properly partitioned the `stm32f334 Nucleo's` on-board flash-memory, the next step is - `compiling, signing and programming ` 

We will compile the following 
- bootloader 
- boot and update firmware

sign both pieces of firmware with a (test) [private-key](https://github.com/nihalpasham/rustBoot/tree/main/boards/rbSigner/keygen) and finally create valid [`rustBoot mcu-images`](../arch/images.md#mcu-image-format) i.e. signed boot and update firmware images.

> Note:
> - the `ecc256.der` file contains a public-key and a private-key, the first 64 bytes being the public-key and remaining 32 bytes make up the private-key. 
> - This is a test key file and is to be used for testing purposes only.

Compiling, signing and programming can be performed via a single command

```Terminal
cargo stm32f334 build-sign-flash rustBoot [boot-ver] [updt-ver]
```
> Note:
> - The `updt-ver` number should be greater than `boot-ver`.

This will build, sign and flash all 3 packages (i.e. bootloader + boot-fw + update-fw) onto the board.

> Note: 
> - The corresponding public-key is embedded in the bootloader's source.
> - In order to test this example, you'll have to install a couple of pre-requisites  as it uses probe-run to flash the binary.

```powershell
cargo install probe-rs-cli 
cargo install cargo-flash 
```
 
Here's the command line output that should be produced.

## Verifying:

`user led` is used to confirm that rustBoot works as expected. Here's the flow

- Upon supplying power to the board, rustBoot takes over 
    - validates the firmware image stored in the BOOT partition
    - verifies the signature attached against a known public key stored in the rustBoot image.
- If the signature checks out, rustBoot boots into the bootfw and blinks a `user led` for a few seconds, at an interval of `1 second` three times.
    - post which, the boot firmware triggers the update and performs a system reset. 
- Upon reset, the rustBoot again takes over 
    - validates the firmware image stored in the UPDATE partition 
    - swaps the contents of the BOOT and the UPDATE partitions
    - marks the new firmware in the BOOT partition as in state STATE_TESTING
    - boots into the UPDATE'd firmware 
- Now that execution-control has been transferred to the UPDATE'd firmware 
    - and set a `confirmation flag` to indicate that the update was successful.
    - post which, it continuously blinks a `user led` at an interval of `0.25 second` continuously.
